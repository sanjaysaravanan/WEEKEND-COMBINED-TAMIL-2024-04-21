  2. Using Fetch for API requests
      CRUD:
        Read - GET
            Reading the all the data from the Server
        Create - POST
        Update - PUT/PATCH
        Delete - DELETE

  4. Implementing CRUD operations using react & axios
    using Fetch Done

Next Session:

  3. Axios vs Fetch

      Axios - separate library which helps in handling API requests and other API related operations

        Instance: axios allows to keep multiple instances ( Multiple server instances )

        It uses XHR for api interaction

        Reduces the JSON.stringfy and JSON.parsing ( response.json() )

        Interceptors:
          added advantage where we can intercept both request & response

      Fetch - JavaScript inbuilt API/fetch for handling API requests & other API related operations

      Fetch is also capable of doing all the things that axios can do

      But axios do those in a simpler way
